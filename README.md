# Grephy
Formal Language and Computability

## Project Details
Create file  called grephy, that searches files for regular expression pattern matches and produces dot graph file
output for the automata used in the matching computation. Using Thompons's Construciton / Algorithim to convert from RegEx to postfi and postfix to NFA, then uses subset construction to convert NFA to DFA.
